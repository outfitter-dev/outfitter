# Plugin Engineer Overview

Quick reference for the repo-to-plugin transformation workflow.

## Stages

| Stage | Skill Loaded | Output |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| 1. Discovery | `outfitter:research` | `artifacts/plugin-engineer/discovery.md` |
| 2. Recon | `outfitter:codebase-recon` | `artifacts/plugin-engineer/recon.md` |
| 3. Patterns | `outfitter:patterns` | `artifacts/plugin-engineer/patterns.md` |
| 4. Mapping | `outfitter:codify` | `artifacts/plugin-engineer/mapping.md` |
| 5. Authoring | `outfitter:skills-dev` | `artifacts/plugin-engineer/components/` |
| 6. Packaging | `outfitter:claude-plugins` | Plugin directory |
| 7. Audit | `outfitter:claude-plugins` | `artifacts/plugin-engineer/audit.md` |

## Quick Mode

Skip stages 3-4 for simple repos:

```
Discovery → Recon → Authoring → Packaging → Audit
```

Trigger: Single-purpose tool, < 5 commands, user requests speed.

## Common Pitfalls

**Over-engineering**: Creating agents when skills suffice, multiple commands for related actions.

**Under-engineering**: Single skill doing everything, missing error handling, no documentation.

**Scope creep**: Adding "nice to have" features before core works.

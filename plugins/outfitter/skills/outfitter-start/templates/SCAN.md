Suggested first install set (adjust based on the table above):

```bash
bun add @outfitter/contracts @outfitter/logging @outfitter/config
```

Add transport/runtime packages as needed:

```bash
bun add @outfitter/cli @outfitter/mcp @outfitter/daemon @outfitter/file-ops @outfitter/testing
```

Install `@outfitter/types` only when you have concrete branded type or utility adoption points.

## Migration Plan

See [stages/](./stages/) for stage-by-stage breakdown:

1. [Foundation](./stages/foundation.md) — Dependencies, context, logger
2. [Handlers](./stages/handlers.md) — Convert to Result-returning handlers
3. [Errors](./stages/errors.md) — Map to error taxonomy
4. [Paths](./stages/paths.md) — XDG-compliant paths
5. [Adapters](./stages/adapters.md) — CLI/MCP transport layers
6. [Documents](./stages/documents.md) — Update documentation
7. [Unknowns](./stages/unknowns.md) — Items requiring review

## Next Steps

1. Review this report for accuracy
2. Adjust priorities in [stages/overview.md](./stages/overview.md)
3. Begin with Stage 1 (Foundation)

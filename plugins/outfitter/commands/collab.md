# Pathfinding

Adaptive Q&A workflow to clarify requirements and build confidence before delivering.

## Steps

1. **Load** — Use the Skill tool to load the **outfitter:pathfinding** skill
2. **Consider** — Assess the context below and recent conversation. Ultrathink.
3. **Execute** — Begin the pathfinding workflow per the skill

## Guidance

- This may be greenfield exploration — help shape the idea, not just refine it
- Use EnterPlanMode for questions (enables keyboard selection)
- Ask about literally anything: scope, constraints, tradeoffs, UX, technical approach, concerns
- Make sure questions are non-obvious — don't re-ask what's already clear from context
- Be persistent — continue until confidence level 5 or user requests early delivery

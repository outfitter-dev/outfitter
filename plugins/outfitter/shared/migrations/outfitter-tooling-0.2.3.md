# @outfitter/tooling → 0.2.3

## New APIs

`0.2.1`–`0.2.3` adds repo-maintenance and release-safety improvements:

- Migration-system packaging support (`0.2.1`)
- npm publish retry support (`0.2.2`)
- `check-changeset` CI gate and boundary/bootstrap updates (`0.2.3`)

## Migration Steps

- Upgrade directly from `0.2.0` to `0.2.3`.
- Add `check-changeset` to CI if you validate package-source changes in pull requests.

## No Action Required

- Existing tooling presets and command usage remain compatible.

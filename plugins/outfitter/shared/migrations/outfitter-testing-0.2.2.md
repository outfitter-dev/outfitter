# @outfitter/testing → 0.2.2

## New APIs

No new test harness APIs in `0.2.1`–`0.2.2`; updates are dependency alignment with newer MCP/contracts packages.

## Migration Steps

- Upgrade directly from `0.2.0` to `0.2.2`.

## No Action Required

- Existing CLI/MCP test harness usage remains compatible.

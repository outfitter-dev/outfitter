# @outfitter/cli → 0.4.1

## New APIs

No new runtime APIs. This patch improves TypeScript subpath export typing resolution for `@outfitter/cli/output` and related entries.

## Migration Steps

- Update to `0.4.1` if your project sees type resolution issues for CLI subpath imports.

## No Action Required

- Runtime behavior and command semantics are unchanged from `0.4.0`.

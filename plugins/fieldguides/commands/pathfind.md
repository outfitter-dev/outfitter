# Pathfinding

Adaptive Q&A workflow to clarify requirements and build confidence before delivering.

## Steps

1. **Load** — Use the Skill tool to load the `pathfinding` skill
2. **Consider** — Assess the recent conversation and any context provided below
3. **Plan** — Enter `Plan` mode to talk through the problem or feature to explore
3. **Execute** — Begin the workflow per the skill

## Guidance

- This may be greenfield exploration — help shape the idea, not just refine it
- Use the AskUserQuestion tool for questions (enables keyboard selection)
- Ask about literally anything: scope, constraints, tradeoffs, UX, technical approach, concerns
- Make sure questions are non-obvious — don't re-ask what's already clear from context
- Be persistent — continue until confidence level 5 or user requests early delivery

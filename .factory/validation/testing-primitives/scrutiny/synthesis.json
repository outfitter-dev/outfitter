      "description": "testCommand() restores previously-unset env vars via `process.env[key] = undefined` instead of `delete process.env[key]`. This leaves the key present on process.env (Object.hasOwn returns true), which is inconsistent with fixtures.ts:withEnv() in the same package that correctly uses `delete`. The value is correctly undefined, so no functional impact for typical usage, but key-presence leakage violates strict 'fully restored' semantics.",
      "suggestedFix": "Change line 89 in test-command.ts from `process.env[key] = undefined` to `delete process.env[key]` to match the withEnv() pattern in fixtures.ts."

    {
      "observation": "Environment restoration semantics are not explicitly documented in mission shared state, and this led to inconsistent restoration behavior in new code.",

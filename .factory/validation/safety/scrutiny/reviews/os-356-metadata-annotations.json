    "summary": "Implementation matches the feature requirements: CommandBuilder now supports readOnly/idempotent metadata signals, command-tree JSON includes metadata, MCP tool construction maps readOnly/idempotent to readOnlyHint/idempotentHint, and a minor changeset was added for affected packages.",

    {

      "observation": "Validator command execution in practice is using shell pipelines that can mask non-zero exit codes; this can make handoff exitCode values unreliable.",
      "evidence": "Transcript skeleton shows commands like `bun test --filter=@outfitter/cli 2>&1 | tail -10`. Handoff verification then reports `exitCode: 0` while the same entry states `4016 pass, 2 fail` for that command."

  "summary": "Reviewed commit c4aed878 for os-356-metadata-annotations and found the feature behavior complete and correctly wired across CLI command metadata, command-tree JSON, and MCP annotations. No code defects were identified for VAL-SAFE-004/005."

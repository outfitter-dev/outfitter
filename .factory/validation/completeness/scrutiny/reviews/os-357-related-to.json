    "summary": "The feature adds .relatedTo() on CommandBuilder, stores relationship metadata on commands, introduces action-graph helpers and tier-4 hint generators, and includes a minor changeset with targeted tests. However, the action graph implementation does not traverse nested commands, so it does not actually cover all registered commands.",
    "issues": [
      {
        "file": "packages/cli/src/hints.ts",
        "line": 424,
        "severity": "blocking",
        "description": "buildActionGraph only iterates program.commands (top-level) and never recurses into subcommands. This omits nested registered commands from graph nodes/edges, can mislabel valid nested targets as unknown, and yields incomplete tier-4 hints for real CLIs with grouped subcommands."
      }
    ]

  "sharedStateObservations": [],
  "addressesFailureFrom": null,
  "summary": "Fail: implementation is close, but graph construction misses nested registered commands, which leaves the OS-357 requirement ('all registered commands') partially unmet."

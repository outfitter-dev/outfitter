      "evidence": "All 7 documentation feature reviews across round 1 noted this mismatch, and the round 2 fix worker also deviated (ran lint+typecheck instead of check). The docs-worker SKILL.md:65 prescribes `bun run check`, while mission AGENTS.md:72 documents it as crashing. All workers correctly followed mission guidance over skill guidance.",

      "evidence": "Feature os-339-cli-patterns-docs shipped with wrong import paths in round 1 (@outfitter/cli instead of @outfitter/cli/command) despite the skill requiring cross-referencing. A stricter verification step (e.g., `bun -e 'import {...} from \"...\"'`) would have caught this.",

The command mapping correctly reflects the repo's scripts. Mission-level workarounds belong in mission AGENTS.md, not services.yaml."

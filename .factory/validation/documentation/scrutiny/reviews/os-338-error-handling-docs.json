    "summary": "The new contracts doc exists at packages/contracts/docs/error-handling-patterns.md and fully covers the requested scope: error boundaries (Result for domain errors; throws for protocol/startup failures), MCP Result boundary guidance, visible 10-category taxonomy with exit/HTTP mapping, and an adaptHandler() bridge example for domain errors extending Error but not OutfitterError. Referenced APIs/imports in examples match exported source symbols and package exports.",

      "observation": "The docs-worker procedure requires running `bun run check`, but this mission explicitly marks `bun run check` as a known crashing command and directs workers to run `bun run lint` + `bun run typecheck` instead. The worker followed mission guidance, indicating the skill procedure is stale for this environment.",

  "addressesFailureFrom": null,
  "summary": "Review passed. The OS-338 documentation implementation matches the feature requirements and the committed content is accurate to source exports/signatures; one non-blocking shared-state note was recorded about docs-worker verification guidance being out of sync with mission-specific known tooling issues."

    "summary": "The feature intent is satisfied: the new MCP docs page documents post-connect registerTool() auto-notification, explains the auth-gated dynamic registration flow, and aligns with source behavior in server/transport and notification tests. I found one minor wording inconsistency in the manual-notification section.",
    "issues": [
      {
        "file": "packages/mcp/docs/dynamic-tool-registration.md",
        "line": 100,
        "severity": "non_blocking",
        "description": "The section claims explicit control over when notifications fire for bulk registration, and line 103 implies registration without per-tool notifications, but post-connect registerTool() still auto-notifies each call. The wording is internally contradictory and may mislead readers about suppression behavior."

    {
      "area": "skills",
      "observation": "The docs-worker skill procedure mandates `bun run check`, but mission-level AGENTS guidance marks `bun run check` as a known crashing command and instructs `bun run lint` + `bun run typecheck` instead. This creates a procedure mismatch in this mission context.",

  "addressesFailureFrom": null,
  "summary": "Pass with one non-blocking docs clarity note. The implementation delivers the requested documentation for registerTool() post-connect auto-notification and auth-gated dynamic tool registration, and the described behavior is supported by source and tests."

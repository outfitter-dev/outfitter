    "summary": "The new guide covers all required topic areas with strong detail, but it contains blocking import-path errors in multiple examples: `createCLI`/`command` are imported from `@outfitter/cli` even though those APIs are exported from the `@outfitter/cli/command` subpath.",

        "description": "Example imports for `createCLI`/`command` use `@outfitter/cli` (also at lines 35, 56, 108, and 207). Root exports map to `dist/index.js` and do not export those APIs; they are exported via `./command`. This violates the feature expectation that examples use correct import paths."

    "summary": "The commit adds a dedicated MCP package doc at packages/mcp/docs/adapt-handler.md that fully covers the requested adaptHandler() use case: it explains the domain-error type mismatch problem, shows adaptHandler() as the bridge solution, includes a realistic end-to-end example, and documents when to use adaptHandler() vs passing handlers directly. The documented signature matches packages/mcp/src/types.ts.",

      "observation": "There is guidance drift between the docs-worker skill and mission guidance for verification commands. The skill says to run `bun run check`, while this mission's AGENTS.md says `bun run check` is known to crash and workers should run `bun run lint` plus `bun run typecheck` instead.",

  "summary": "Review completed for os-325-adapt-handler-docs: implementation passes. The documentation file added in commit 3bb8e3b9 satisfies the feature requirements and aligns with source signatures/types. One shared-state observation was noted about verification-command guidance drift between skill instructions and mission AGENTS guidance."

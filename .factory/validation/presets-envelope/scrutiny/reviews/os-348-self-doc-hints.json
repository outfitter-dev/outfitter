        "description": "The root no-subcommand mode check only considers `--json`, `OUTFITTER_JSON`, and `OUTFITTER_JSONL`. It does not detect non-TTY/piped execution, so piped runs without explicit JSON env/flag fall through to `program.outputHelp()` instead of emitting JSON command tree output, which violates the required 'piped/JSON mode vs TTY help mode' behavior."

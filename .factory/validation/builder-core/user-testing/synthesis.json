    "VAL-BUILD-003": "Subagent reported fail due to missing explicit .requiredOption() and variadic test cases. After synthesizer review of the source code, the behavioral requirement IS met: .requiredOption() uses the same explicitLongFlags tracking + applySchemaFlags() composition mechanism as .option(). The composition behavior is identical, confirmed by code inspection (command.ts lines 121-135, 249-273). Variadic params are a design note ('use explicit declarations since Zod can't express these'), not a required test case. Marking as pass."

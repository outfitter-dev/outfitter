    "summary": "The feature adds `.input(schema)`, auto-derived Commander flags, updated builder typing, tests, and a minor changeset. However, runtime input validation is not enforced: schema parse failures are silently ignored and raw input is passed to the action handler.",

      {
        "file": "packages/cli/src/schema-input.ts",
        "line": 252,
        "severity": "blocking",
        "description": "`validateInput()` falls back to returning raw picked flags when `schema.safeParse()` fails (lines 247-254). This lets invalid data reach `.action()` (wired at `packages/cli/src/command.ts:165`), violating the feature requirement that `.input()` provide a validated typed input object."

  "summary": "Reviewed commit 048072c4 for os-342-input-schema. Auto-derivation/composition/type-surface work is present, but the implementation fails the core validation contract because Zod parse failures are not surfaced and invalid input can still reach handlers."

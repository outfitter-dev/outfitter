    "summary": "Implementation matches feature requirements: ActionHint/CLIHint/MCPHint are defined with the required shapes, exported from the contracts root and the new /hints subpath, and a minor changeset was added. The hint module is type-only and introduces no runtime behavior.",

    {
      "area": "skills",
      "observation": "The library-worker skill's Red-phase requirement is not realistic for type-only features in this repo: type-only imports in Bun tests do not force a failing runtime test, and contracts package typecheck excludes src/__tests__, so workers cannot reliably demonstrate a red test before implementation.",
      "evidence": "Session 4a76a3e6-7134-475a-914a-ecc2fe8dcb51 transcript notes: tests passed with `import type` before implementation, then confirms package typecheck still passes because tests are excluded from tsconfig. Handoff `skillFeedback.suggestedChanges` calls out this exact gap."

  "addressesFailureFrom": null,
  "summary": "Reviewed commit d75b90d290ef83bf0fe5eeb2fb450d462b73e555 for os-337-hint-types. Feature is correctly implemented and meets expected behavior; review passes. One skill-procedure gap was identified for handling type-only TDD red-phase expectations."

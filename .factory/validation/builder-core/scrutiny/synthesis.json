      "description": "validateInput() in packages/cli/src/schema-input.ts (lines 247-254) falls back to returning raw picked flags when schema.safeParse() fails. This means invalid data can reach the .action() handler via the `input` field (packages/cli/src/command.ts:208), violating the feature requirement that .input(schema) provides a validated typed input object. The function should either surface the validation error (e.g., call exitWithError with a ValidationError) or return a Result type so the caller can handle it.",

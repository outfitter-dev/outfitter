Feature description requires each of 8 entries to include before/after code and migration steps. These sections have migration steps and new API code but no 'Before (v0.5)' / 'After (v0.6)' contrast. Note: truncation and file pointers are entirely new features (no prior API existed), so 'before' would show the absence of the feature or manual approaches."

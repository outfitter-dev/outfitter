    "summary": "The fix commit fully addresses both prior blocking findings. In examples/reference/src/cli.ts, the create command now invokes the v0.5 .context() builder API and uses context-derived values in the action path. In docs/migration-v0.6.md, sections 6 and 7 now include explicit Before/After code pairs showing pre-v0.6 manual/no-truncation patterns and v0.6 truncateOutput() + TruncationOptions usage.",

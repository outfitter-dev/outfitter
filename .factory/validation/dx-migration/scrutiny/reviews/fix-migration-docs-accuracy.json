    "summary": "The fix commit addresses both prior blocking inaccuracies in docs/migration-v0.5.md and now matches source behavior. I reviewed both diffs (original failing commit 905c38dc and fix commit 8d776b82): the testCommand section now correctly states input is converted to CLI args, and the codemod section now correctly states transformation to .input(schema).action(). Source alignment was confirmed against packages/testing/src/test-command.ts and plugins/outfitter/shared/codemods/cli/commander-to-builder.ts.",

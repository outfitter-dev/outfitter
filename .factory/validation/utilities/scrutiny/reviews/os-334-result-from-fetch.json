    "summary": "Implementation meets the feature intent: fromFetch(response) returns Ok for 2xx, maps required HTTP statuses to the expected error categories, is exported from @outfitter/contracts, and includes tests plus a minor changeset.",

      {
        "file": "packages/contracts/src/from-fetch.ts",
        "line": 28,
        "severity": "non_blocking",
        "description": "HTTP status-to-category mapping is re-declared locally instead of deriving from the canonical taxonomy mapping in errors.ts (statusCodeMap). Behavior is correct now, but this introduces drift risk if taxonomy mappings evolve."

      "observation": "The library-worker export verification procedure assumes root-level workspace imports (`@outfitter/<pkg>`), but this failed in the reviewed run; the worker had to switch to package-local dist import. Skill guidance should include this fallback to avoid repeated false negatives.",

      "area": "knowledge",
      "observation": "The user-testing library guidance repeats the same root-level import verification pattern that failed during this feature run, so local verification guidance is potentially misleading for this monorepo setup.",

      "area": "skills",
      "observation": "library-worker contains conflicting verification guidance: one section says not to use `bun run check` due known crash, but the example handoff still lists `bun run check`.",

  "summary": "Review result: pass. Feature implementation is functionally complete for OS-334 with one non-blocking maintainability concern and shared-state documentation/skill gaps captured for triage."

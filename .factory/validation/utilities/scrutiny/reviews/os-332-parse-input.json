    "summary": "Implementation matches the feature requirements: parseInput(schema, data) was added in contracts validation utilities, wraps safeParse into Result<z.infer<TSchema>, ValidationError>, is exported from package root, has dedicated tests for valid/invalid parsing and inference behavior, and includes a minor changeset.",

      "observation": "The library-worker export-verification command is unreliable in this monorepo context: it instructs importing '@outfitter/<pkg>' from eval, but that import failed for this worker session and required local dist/source import fallbacks.",

      "area": "knowledge",
      "observation": "User-testing library guidance currently repeats the same root-level package import check that failed in this mission, so the shared testing knowledge is partially inaccurate for local validation runs.",

  "summary": "Reviewed commit e9ca259cd25137322fcf57bc7d0a24f895facfe6 for os-332-parse-input and found the feature correctly implemented and tested with no code defects identified against stated expectations. Logged shared-state documentation/skill procedure gaps around export verification and changeset workflow in this execution environment."

    "summary": "The implementation matches the feature intent: resolvePresetDependencyVersions() now returns Result and catches thrown failures in the resolution flow, callers were updated to handle Result, cache behavior is preserved, and explicit failure-path tests were added.",

    {
      "area": "conventions",
      "observation": "Mission AGENTS guidance is internally inconsistent for formatting reliability in this mission: it instructs workers to use bun run format:fix, but only documents bun run check/format:check as the known crashing path. The reviewed worker transcript shows bun run format:fix also hitting the same tokio panic.",
      "evidence": "Mission AGENTS.md: line 21 recommends `bun run format:fix`; line 72 documents tokio panic only for `bun run check`/`format:check`. Transcript skeleton for session a06d1db2-981a-4559-bc96-29cc0d37ea37 explicitly notes `bun run format:fix` crashed with `tokio-runtime-worker panicked`."

      "observation": "library-worker skill has contradictory verification guidance: procedural text says not to use bun run check due pre-existing format:check crash, but the embedded example handoff still includes bun run check as a successful verification command.",
      "evidence": ".factory/skills/library-worker/SKILL.md line 64 says do NOT use `bun run check`; line 122 example still lists `{ \"command\": \"bun run check\", \"exitCode\": 0 }`."

  "summary": "Pass. Feature requirements were met with no blocking code defects found in commit 0c362b03; only shared-state documentation inconsistencies were observed."

Release catch-up for the current stack after a sustained run of merged changes
across CLI, tooling, runtime packages, and docs workflows.

This intentionally keeps `outfitter` in the `0.3.x` line for the next stable
publish while bumping the rest of the actively published `@outfitter/*`
packages in lockstep.
